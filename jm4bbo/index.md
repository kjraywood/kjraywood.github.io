<!-- # Guide to Using Jitsi Meet with BBO -->

## Some Background

 [Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet) is totally anonymous
  * there are no accounts, therefore no registration etc.
  * any info you choose add to your profile is saved only on your
    device and only shared with other participants
	
Therefore, there is no built-in mechanism to invite anyone because the
servers don't know how to contact you.

## What Device?

If you can, it's preferable to use
  * a desktop computer with a camera in or on top of the monitor
  * a laptop on your desk with the camera at head height -- you might
    need to put the laptop on a stack of books and use an external
    mouse

because

  * we get a more natural view of you looking straight at the camera
    instead of downwards to a phone or tablet
  * it's easy to do things like mute or unmute your sound if you don't
    need to touch your phone

When also using BBO, you can shrink the Jitsi-Meet window and have it
beside the BBO window, or on a second monitor.

## If you must use your phone or tablet

During a meeting, use your phone in landscape mode to match what the
PC and laptop users do. Mount it at head height just beside or above
your computer screen.

## Software Installation

**PC or Laptop**

None. Just use a web-browser. Chrome is preferred but it works with others.

**Phone or Tablet**

Install *Jitsi Meet* from the app store (play store for android)

## Settings

**PC or Laptop**

  * Go to <https://meet.jit.si>
  * Click on the gear symbol (⚙) in the upper right
  * In `Devices`, check that you see video of yourself and that
    audio is working
  * In `Profile`, add your name, and possibly your BBO name too
  * Click `[ Ok ]` to close the Settings pane

**Phone or Tablet**

  * Open Jitsi Meet
  * Tap on the drop-down menu icon (☰) in the upper left
  * Tap on Settings (⚙)
  * Add your name, and possibly your BBO name too
  * Tap the left arrow (←) at the top to finish

## Joining a Meeting

Meetings are defined by a *Room Name*

Since there are no invitations, someone must send you the room name by
some other method; email, text, phone, ...

They might also send a link similar to:  https://meet.jit.si/SomeRoomName

**PC or Laptop**

	* If you received a link, then open it in your browser

    * If you just received a room-name, then open https://meet.jit.si
	  and paste or type the room-name into `Start a Meeting`, then click `[ GO ]`.
	  Just ignore the random names it generates; you can type or paste over them.

**Phone or Tablet**

	* Paste or type the room name (or the link) into Enter room name

## Starting a Meeting

Starting a meeting is just like joining a meeting except that you
decide the room name or you can just use a randomly generated name.
The server will create the meeting when the first participant joins,
and destroy it when the last participant leaves.

### About room names

	* they are NOT case sensitive
	* they may contain plus, minus, underscore or dot,
	  but no other special characters
    * it's best if don't contain spaces

__Acceptable room name:__   Shelleys-Virtual-Bridge-Club  
__Link:__  https://meet.jit.si/Shelleys-Virtual-Bridge-Club

You can also just a randomly generated room-name of four english words
without any spaces or special characters.

## Participating in a Meeting

Once you have joined a meeting, there are several options you can find
from the icons and menu and the bottom of the screen windows.

The tile view is good for a BBO session where there will be times when
no-one is talking.

It's possible to add a password to a meeting which might be desirable
if wanting to add room-names to a web-site and later send the password
to the participants.
